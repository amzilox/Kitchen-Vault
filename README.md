##

## Project Overview :

**[KitchenVault](https://kitchen-vault.netlify.app/)** is a recipe finder app that allows users to explore, save, and share recipes with ease. The app offers a sleek interface and robust search functionality, making it a valuable tool for home cooks and food enthusiasts.

## Key Technologies

- **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**: Advanced styling techniques applied for a polished look.
- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com)**: Used for efficient CSS management with **the 7-1 file architecture**.
- **[JavaScript MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)**: Implements the Model-View-Controller pattern for clean and organized code.
- **[GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)**: Adds smooth and high-performance animations to enhance user experience.

## Known Issues

<p style="font-size: 1.4rem">‚ö†Ô∏è CSS/Sass Focus:</p>

While the application is fully functional with various JavaScript features, there are areas where the CSS/Sass implementation might still need attention:

- **Styling Consistency:** Some elements may not be styled consistently across all devices.
- **Responsive Design:** There may be additional tweaks needed to ensure the design is fully responsive.

These aspects are noted because <span style="font-weight: bold">the primary focus of this project was on implementing JavaScript functionalities and integrating third-party libraries while ensuring adherence to the MVC architecture. The Sass preprocessor was used for styling, and further refinements to the CSS/Sass implementation will be addressed in future updates.</span>
